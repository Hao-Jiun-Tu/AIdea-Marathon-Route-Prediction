### XGBoost
XGBoost is a conventional machine learning method. Model details are omitted here.

## Usage
### Train
1. Transformer + LSTM
    ```
    python train.py -m Transformer
    ```
2. FC-NN
    ```
    python train.py -m FCNN
    ```
3. XGBoost

    Run `xgboost.ipynb` directly.

### Evalute
1. Transformer + LSTM
    ```
    python eval.py -m Transformer
    ```
2. FC-NN
    ```
    python eval.py -m FCNN
    ```
3. XGBoost

    Run `xgboost.ipynb` directly.

## Ablation Study
The following is the ablation study for the four differnt input features trained on XGBoost model. More details about the four features can be seen in `document/Team18_final_report.pdf`.

## Result
FC-NN outperforms than the other two models we proposed, and our best testing loss on AIdea is 0.0471974.
